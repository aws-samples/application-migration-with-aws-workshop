We understand that every migration is different; however, based on our experience with over a million active customers and helping organizations of all ages, industries, and geographies migrate to the cloud, we have seen a standardized migration process take shape. This process can generally be broken into three phases of activities: **1) Assess, 2) Mobilize and 3) Migrate and modernize**.

In this workshop we will focus on **Migrate & Modernize** phase, you will learn how to migrate a fictional application to AWS cloud by:

  - **Re-platforming** of database with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >AWS Database Migration Service</a>
  - **Re-hosting** of webserver with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/application-migration-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >AWS Application Migration Service</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudendure-migration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >AWS CloudEndure Migration</a>
  - **Modernization** of webserver to containers running on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Amazon Elastic Container Service</a>
  - (optional) Improvement of **Operation Excellence**, **Security**, **Performance Efficiency** and **Cost Optimization** of the deployed architecture by following the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Well Architected Framework</a>
